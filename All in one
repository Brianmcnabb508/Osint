Creating an all-in-one OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) search tool for Termux involves combining various modules and APIs to gather information from different sources. Let's create a simple Python-based tool using Termux that integrates with a few popular APIs and services to perform OSINT tasks.



### Step 1: Update and Install Necessary Packages

First, you need to update your Termux environment and install necessary packages like Python and git.



```sh

pkg update && pkg upgrade

pkg install python git

pip install requests

```



### Step 2: Create the OSINT Tool Script

Now, let's create a Python script that will serve as our all-in-one OSINT tool. Create a new file named `osint_tool.py` in your preferred directory.



```sh

nano osint_tool.py

```



Paste the following code into the file. This script demonstrates how to integrate a few basic OSINT functionalities such as getting information from an email address using the Hunter.io API and checking a domain's information using WHOIS.



```python

import requests

import json



# Configuration - Replace with your API keys

HUNTER_API_KEY = "your_hunter_api_key"



# Function to get email data using Hunter API

def get_email_info(email):

    url = f"https://api.hunter.io/v2/email-verifier?email={email}&api_key={HUNTER_API_KEY}"

    response = requests.get(url)

    return response.json() if response.status_code == 200 else None



# Function to get WHOIS data using the Whois XML API

def get_whois_info(domain):

    url = f"https://www.whoisxmlapi.com/whoisserver/WhoisService?apiKey=your_whoisapi_key&domainName={domain}&outputFormat=JSON"

    response = requests.get(url)

    return response.json() if response.status_code == 200 else None



def main():

    print("OSINT Tool")

    print("1. Search Email Information")

    print("2. Search Domain Information")

    choice = input("Enter choice (1 or 2): ")



    if choice == '1':

        email = input("Enter email address: ")

        data = get_email_info(email)

        if data:

            print(json.dumps(data, indent=4))

        else:

            print("Failed to fetch email data.")

    elif choice == '2':

        domain = input("Enter domain name: ")

        data = get_whois_info(domain)

        if data:

            print(json.dumps(data, indent=4))

        else:

            print("Failed to fetch domain data.")

    else:

        print("Invalid choice!")



if __name__ == "__main__":

    main()

```



### Step 3: Run the Script

Make sure the script has the correct API keys inserted and is saved properly. Give it execute permissions and then run it.



```sh

chmod +x osint_tool.py

python osint_tool.py

```



### Step 4: Obtain Necessary API Keys

To make the tool functional, you'll need to obtain API keys from the respective services:



- **Hunter.io API Key**: Sign up at `https://hunter.io/` to get a free API key.

- **WhoisXML API Key**: Sign up at `https://whoisxmlapi.com/` to get a free API key.



### Additional Integrations

You can further expand this tool by integrating other APIs and services for more comprehensive OSINT searches, such as:



- **Shodan**: For searching devices and their vulnerabilities.

- **HaveIBeenPwned**: To check if an email has been involved in a data breach.

- **Social Media APIs**: To gather profiles from various social networking sites.



Remember to handle rate limits and API usage responsibly to avoid being blocked by the services.



### Note

Ensure that you respect privacy and legal boundaries when conducting OSINT operations. Use the tool responsibly and only for ethical purposes.
